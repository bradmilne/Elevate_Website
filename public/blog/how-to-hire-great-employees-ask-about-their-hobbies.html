  	<h3>How to Hire Great Employees: Ask About Their Hobbies</h3>
  	<div class="blog_post_body">
      <p><p>Every business leader from a small business owner to a Fortune 500 marketing director has to face the same problem: how do you find great employees? <b>Great startup employees are particularly difficult to find because they need to be creative and independent but they also need to be extremely reliable because you run a small team and everyone&#39;s work is critical.</b> A great startup team member needs to be able to identify the business objectives of a campaign, come up with an idea for the campaign, identify all of the smaller moving parts that need to be organized, and then follow through and execute the campaign. So how do you find a startup employee who has the qualities necessary to succeed? </p>
<br />

<!--break-->
<p>Everyone has probably read by now that interviews are good at telling you how well a person interviews, but don&#39;t really tell you much about how they&#39;ll perform. We&#39;ve all met very smart people who weren&#39;t stellar at their jobs, so IQ alone won&#39;t tell you how good an employee will. And everyone knows at least one passionate, but ineffective employee, so passion alone won&#39;t cut it. Could it be industry experience? Maybe, but every company has a couple new people with limited experience who are amazing. Experience is extremely valuable, but some people are just great at getting stuff done and can quickly make up for a lack of experience with quick learning and overall effectiveness. <b>So what actually tells you someone is a good employee?</b>  </p>
<br />
<br />
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/hobbies.jpg" /></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><b>The best indicator of a good employee is that they&#39;re good at their hobbies.</b> Why? <b>Because knowing how to get stuff done is the most important single trait of a successful employee.</b> If you can get good at something you love, you know the underlying process needed to get things done. That same process can be applied to work. </p>
<br />
<p><b>And the best indicator that a employee will be a bad employee is that they aren&#39;t good at their own hobbies.</b> Why? <b>Because if someone can&#39;t get good at the things they love to do personally, how on earth do you think they&#39;re going to get good at anything else?</b> You&#39;re probably wondering why, so I&#39;ll explain. </p>

<br />
<p>Before we look at what makes an employee great, we need to think about what makes a great employee. <b>Great employees get stuff done. They find problems to solve and they solve them. They find opportunities and they create wins.</b> They don&#39;t wait until they&#39;re told exactly what to do, they anticipate it. You don&#39;t say, &#34;Get me 1000 followers&#34; and come back to find out they purchased 1000 fake followers. They actually think about the goal and devise a way to achieve. </b>So what makes them special?</b> </p>

<br />
<p><b>Three traits make great employees: Initiative, Thoroughness and Followthrough.</b> These are the traits that make great employees. These are the traits that help someone decide to solve a problem, figure out all the aspects of the problem that needs to be solved, and then put in the time and effort to get it all done.  </p>

<p>So how do I define Initiative, Thoroughness and Followthrough? Here we go:</p>

<br />

<p><b>Initiative:</b> Initiative is the get up and go to look at a problem and say, &#34;I&#39;m going to fix that.&#34; It&#39;s the difference between, &#34;I want to cook,&#34; and &#34;I&#39;m going to learn to cook.&#34;</p>

<br />

<p><b>Thoroughness:</b> Thoroughness is the willingness and forethought to look at the challenge you&#39;re facing and say, &#34;What are all the things I need to solve to solve this problem?&#34; For cooking, it&#39;s learning how to prep, how to use a knife properly, how to select vegetables and meat at the supermarket, etc, and all the other things you need to learn how to cook well. </p>

<br />

<p><b>Followthrough:</b> Followthrough is having the will to actually follow through with learning.<br /><br />
So how do people get initiative, thoroughness and followthrough? Iâ€™m not sure exactly, but I suspect the process of learning hobbies like sports, cooking, music and other pursuits is the most common path. I suspect initiative comes from a belief that you have the ability to solve problems, which usually comes from a parent, teacher or mentor encouraging you early on. Thoroughness usually comes from being taught to be thorough, to think critically and from trying to teach yourself things and learning there&#39;s a lot of little things that need to be learned before you know the big thing you want to learn. Followthrough comes from keeping trying until you&#39;ve learned all the little things until you finally know the big thing you set out to learn. All of which is a way too detailed way of saying that <b>people who have initiative, thoroughness and followthrough are good at their hobbies. How do you know? Because that&#39;s how they got good at them.</b></p>

<p>Have you noticed that many or most of your best employees and colleagues are good at their hobbies? Have you noticed any hobbies in particular that indicate initiative, thoroughness and followthrough? I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts! </p>
