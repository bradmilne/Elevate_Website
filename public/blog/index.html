    <div class="post_date">October 18, 2013</div>
    <p>With mobile traffic now representing about <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/12/04/5-eye-opening-stats-that-show-the-world-is-going-mobile/">13&#37; of all internet traffic</a>, it&#39;s clear that mobile is well positioned to sit beside desktops as the way the world interacts online in the near future. This obviously has had and will continue to cause a number of changes in the online world. Some major trends already are the move to responsive web design, and the battle between HTML5 and apps to take full advantage of smartphones.</p>


<p><br /></p>

<p>But for us in the B2B content marketing world, this movement to mobile brings up a major issue: since there is so little advertising space on mobile sites, <b>how can you reach your audience on their mobile device?</b></p>

    <div class="post_date">October 18, 2013</div>
    <p>Social media managers put their heart, time and energy into creating and finding great content to share online, but often the most important posts aren&#39;t seen by their target audience- or even their most loyal followers. Although great content often rises to the top, sometimes due to bad timing or just plain old random chance that content doesnâ€™t get shared by the first few people who see it. <b>In this post I&#39;m going to outline a concise explanation of how content spreads (or doesn&#39;t) and how you can maximize the chances of getting your content into the hands of the people who most need to read it.</b></p>

    <div class="post_date">October 18, 2013</div>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/truth.jpg" /></p>


<p><br /></p>

<p>With brand advocacy gaining prominence as a <a href="http://www.mackcollier.com/ibm-study-cmos-look-to-focus-on-social-media-connecting-with-brand-advocates/">priority for CMOs</a>, more and more marketers are being tasked with getting a brand advocate program up and running for their company or division. However as a new concept, it&#39;s not that easy to just &#39;set it up.&#39; The truth is that there aren&#39;t that many blueprints or public examples of successful programs that a marketer can just copy.</p>


<p><br /></p>

<p>The other issue is that there are a number of different way to run brand advocate programs. Are you trying to promote content or are you trying to drive leads? Brand advocates are very powerful in that they represent a trusted voice about your brand online and they have considerable influence on their online connections or people who can see them publicly speaking about a company in search results. </p>

<p>Employee advocates are important not just because they are a strong measure of a brand&#39;s strength and trustworthiness, but also because they help a brand amplify their owned media reach and generate earned media. This blog post explains some of the motivations that drive employees and partners to advocate for a company by sharing their social content.</p>


<p><br /></p>

<p>In late 2012 I published a short blog post called the &#39;<a href="http://blog.getelevate.com/blog/bid/167921/The-Science-of-Social-Business-Motivate-Employees-to-Participate">The Science of Social Business: What Motivates Employees to Participate,&#39;</a> looking at how Dan Pink&#39;s &#39;Drive&#39; applied to motivating employees to participate in social media programs. That post generated a lot of great discussions, including one in particular with <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoods">Steve Woods</a>, Co-Founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.eloqua.com/">Eloqua</a>, the leading marketing automation and demand generation platform that sold to Oracle for &#126;&#36;850 million in late 2012. In addition to being a hugely successful founder and marketing technology executive, Steve is also the author of &#39;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Body-Language-Steven-Woods/dp/0979988551">Digital Body Language</a>&#39;, an Amazon best seller explaining how customers use the internet to learn about your company and decide what to buy.</p>

    <p>So, you started a social media ambassador program. You are on your way to the content marketing equivalent of the 6th level of heaven with eyes on the 7th.

    <p>Every business leader from a small business owner to a Fortune 500 marketing director has to face the same problem: how do you find great employees? <b>Great startup employees are particularly difficult to find because they need to be creative and independent but they also need to be extremely reliable because you run a small team and everyone&#39;s work is critical.</b> A great startup team member needs to be able to identify the business objectives of a campaign, come up with an idea for the campaign, identify all of the smaller moving parts that need to be organized, and then follow through and execute the campaign. So how do you find a startup employee who has the qualities necessary to succeed? </p>

    <p>One of the most consistent challenges companies face with content marketing is that they get a lot less engagement than they should for the amount of time and money they&#39;re spending. Why? The Three Horsemen of the No Sharing Apocalypse: Inconvenience, Forgetfulness, and Busyness. <b>If you want more people to share your posts, you&#39;ve got to make it more convenient for people to share, gently remind them you would like them to share your posts, and ask at a time that they&#39;re not already really busy.</b> In this post I&#39;m going to explain how to use email to solve this problem. </p>


<p><br /></p>

<p>Your loyal customers and employees love your brand, love your content, and want to support your company. They have the best intentions to be your advocates and social ambassadors. <b>But on the road to advocacy, the best intentions often get waylaid by Inconvenience, Forgetfulness, and Busyness.</b></p>

    <p>2013 seems to be the year where B2B marketing departments will fully embrace content marketing as their highest priority marketing initiative.

<p>For anyone who has worked in B2B social media, you&#39;ll know that it&#39;s a different beast than B2C social media where there is much more engagement and identification with the brand. For B2B accounting firms, the online audience on LinkedIn and Twitter is much more engaged by two factors:</p>
