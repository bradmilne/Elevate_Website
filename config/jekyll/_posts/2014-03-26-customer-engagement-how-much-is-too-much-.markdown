title: 'Customer Engagement: How Much is Too Much?'
---

<br />
<p>A question we frequently get asked in regards to customer engagement is, <b>&#39;how much is too much?&#39;</b></p>

<p>The reality is we haven&#39;t seen a one-sized fits all approach but there&#39;s one thing we&#39;re 100&#37; sure of: <b>having no customer engagement strategy at all is a surefire way to unengaged customers.</b></p><br />

<p>We’re firm believers in that all marketing should provide value for the prospect or customer. It should educate them about your product or services, provide them useful insights on markets where they make purchases, or keep them aware of opportunities that will benefit them.</p><br />

<p>On the other hand, we&#39;re also firm believers in having a point (preferably measurable) to any marketing activities. <b>Companies shouldn&#39;t treat marketing like checking a box but instead use marketing as a measurable tool to stimulate market demand.</b></p><br />

<p>That said, when it comes to customer engagement, the first important thing to define is what are the benefits <p>for the customer. Some potential benefits are:</p><br /><br />

<br />

<p>1) reminders of products or services they need to purchase (e.g. you should file your taxes before the deadline)</p><br />

<p>2) provide time-sensitive opportunities like 50&#37; off sales</p><br />

<p>3) deliver them relevant news about your industry so that they don’t have to stay on top of important changes in regulation, deadlines, or advancements e.g. you hire a broker to stay on top of all market news so you don&#39;t have to</p><br />

<p><b>The next step to define is what are the benefits that you will receive from spending time, money and mental energy on marketing.</b> Some common things we hear listed are:</p><br /><br />

<p> 1) driving qualified up-sell or cross-sell opportunities to sales teams</p><br />
<p> 2) gathering valuable client insights on needs, wants and preferences</p><br />
<p> 3) staying &#39;top of mind&#39; with current customers in between purchases</p><br />
<p> 4) reinforcing a thought leadership position</p><br /><br />

<p>All of the above are very valid reasons to spend time and effort on customer engagement and the individual importance of each varies from company to company and marketing team to marketing team.</p><br />

<p>Back to the original question: &#39;how much is too much?&#39;</p><br />

<p>One of the ways that we like to test this at Elevate is by seeing at what point customer engagement begins to drop off at the expense of frequency of engagement. What we&#39;ve seen here is that as long as the engagement is of high quality and useful to the customer, engagement likely will remain high. We even run some customer engagement programs where customers are sent our newsletters twice a week with absolutely no drop off in engagement.</p><br />

<p>So while we&#39;re often asked &#39;how much is too much?&#39;, when we consider the benefits of a highly engaged customer base, <b>the better question to ask is &#39;how little is too little?&#39;</b></p><br />
