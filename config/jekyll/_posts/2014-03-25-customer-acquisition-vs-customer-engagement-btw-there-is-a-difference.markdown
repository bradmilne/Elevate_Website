title: Customer Acquisition vs. Customer Engagement (BTW There Is A Difference)
---
<p>The sales process is fascinating. As I learn more and more about it and dive into all the tools that help capture leads, I&#39;m in awe of the thinking and technology that’s been developed around it. 
<br/>
Producing content, building trust, exchanging a whitepaper for an email address, dripping helpful content to people, providing calls to action after the person is familiar with you... it’s also just plain interesting to study it for the first time.</p>
<br />

<p>For those that haven&#39;t spent a lot of time thinking about it, it essentially boils down to this:</p>

<br />

<p>You need to build trust with a prospect with content dripped to them over a period of time. This helps educate and inform the prospect and builds trust with them. Along the way you start with calls to action to get them to sign up for your product or service.</p>

<br />

<p>What&#39;s great about this is that companies aren’t shoving their products and services in your face and are genuinely earning your trust by providing you with valuable information to make your purchasing decision. </p><br />

<p>The goal of this is to methodically educate your potential customer about your expertise in your industry and your ability to help them.</p><br />

<p>Now consider the relationship between you and an existing customer. They&#39;ve learned about your product or service, they&#39;ve spoken to a sales rep and they’ve actually purchased from you, dealt with your customer service, and have made a judgement of the actual value you provide. In short - they&#39;ve learned all they really need to know about you for the most part.</p><br />

<p>The relationship has fundamentally changed. In the beginning the favor you can do for potential prospects is educating them about you while not trying to sell them too hard. For ongoing customer engagement, you need to provide value that goes beyond telling them about yourself.</p><br />

<p>There are a few ways that I think can accomplish this:</p><br /><br />

<p>1.) <b>Do nothing</b></p><br />

<p>This is probably the most common strategy or lack thereof. We&#39;re always amazed how little attention is paid to customer engagement given that the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130604134550-284615-15-statistics-that-should-change-the-business-world-but-haven-t">&#39;The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60&#37; - 80&#37; and the probabily of selling to a new prospect is 5&#37; - 20&#37;.&#39;</a></p><br />

<p>2.) <b>Keep your customer informed about yourself</b></p><br />

<p>Since you know you provide a service your customer (hopefully) needs, then it’s important to update them with any new aspects of your business offering, staffing, etc. This is genuinely useful and also helps to stay top of mind with your customers.</p><br />

<p>3.) <b>Educate your customer about your industry</b></p><br />

<p>If your customer has made a purchase from you then you know that they care enough about what you do to spend money on it. One of the most valuable things you can do is take the responsibility of being their expert on this topic. By selecting only the most important news / ongoings in your industry and sending it to them, you&#39;re providing ongoing value so that the customer is well informed for all future purchasing decisions.</p><br />

<p><b>The point is that your prospects and customers are different and should be treated such. As a vendor of products and services, you should be doing your best to educate potential purchasers. </b></p><br />

<p><b>What you educate them on however, needs to be different depending on whether they are a potential or current customer.</b></p><br />
