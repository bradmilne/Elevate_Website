title: 6 Ways Accounting Firms Can Drive More Social Media Engagement
---

<p>Having worked on the social media strategy of a few accounting firms now, I was recently asked about some tips on how to increase the engagement of a b2b accounting firm&#39;s social media accounts.</p>

<p>For anyone who has worked in B2B social media, you&#39;ll know that it&#39;s a different beast than B2C social media where there is much more engagement and identification with the brand. For B2B accounting firms, the online audience on LinkedIn and Twitter is much more engaged by two factors:</p>

<p>1) <b>Thought Leadership</b> - content which genuinely advances the professional knowledge of the person consuming it</p>

<p>2) <b>Pre-Existing Relationships</b> - the individuals that the audience has done business with before at the firm</p>

<br />


<p>With this in mind, I&#39;ve put together 6 tips that can help drive engagement for any accounting firm&#39;s social media presence.</p>

<br />


<p>1) <b>Reshare Employees&#39; Posts</b> <br /> Because business relationships are usually handled at a partner level, a great way to increase the visibility of partners and employees is to re-share them from regional and national level accounts. This helps not only highlight these people in front of their colleagues and clients, but it increases the credibility of what they share online.</p>
<br />

<p>2) <b>Establish Thought Leadership</b> <br /> When clients and potential clients see your LinkedIn group or Twitter accounts, they are going to judge what&#39;s posted. Keep in mind your audience is people who have a need for accounting services and for them identify you as a trusted source and advisor of accounting knowledge, you should be sharing content that reinforces that position. Whitepapers, relevant industry news and important dates and industry developments all help in this regard.</p>
<br />

<p>3) <b>Ask Employees to Follow You</b> <br /> This is something I&#39;ve seen time and time again - the firm creates a social account that represents an industry or business practice and doesn&#39;t let the partners and employees know that they should follow it and share it online. Make sure that everyone in the company knows where to find you and what kind of content you&#39;ll be sharing.</p>
<br />


<p>4) <b>Mimic the Best Accounts</b> <br /> Audience building is a constant and important task. Make sure that the people you most want to engage with you know that your account exists, is active and worthwhile to follow. Every time you follow an account they get notified that your account exists and will likely check out your account. Don&#39;t be shy!
</p>
<br />

<p>5) <b>Follow Clients & Industry Leaders</b> <br /> It&#39;s sound social media advice for any marketing team in any industry, but it applies just as much to B2B accounting. You don&#39;t get a medal for reinventing the wheel and many social media best practices are easy to observe in the top LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. Content type, quality, frequency, engagement style - they&#39;re all here on display for you to see.
</p>
<br />

<p>6) <b>Got Something Important? Ask Employees to Reshare</b> <br /> You don&#39;t have to wait for employees to passively find an important post - go ahead and let them know that you&#39;ve just put something important online that they might want to share with their clients and leads. You&#39;re certainly not doing anyone a disservice by providing important or high quality information that they can share with their own networks.
<br /><br />
Building an effective social media presence for a B2B accounting isn&#39;t easy considering the large range of clients and types of work accounting firms do, but itâ€™s very possible and certainly worthwhile to amplify the brand, increase client contact, and reinforce credibility as a thought leader .
