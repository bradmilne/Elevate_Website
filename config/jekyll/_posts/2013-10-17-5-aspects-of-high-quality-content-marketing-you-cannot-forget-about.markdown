title: 5 Aspects of High Quality Content Marketing You Cannot Forget About
---
<p>Content marketing is hot these days in the marketing world. From the CMO down, marketers understand that building trust with their audience through the form of content that demonstrates expertise is a winning formula. One that looks like it will remain effective as effective in the digital world as it has been in the offline world for as long as marketing has existed.</p>
<br />

<p>However given that marketing has shifted online to where the audience is, content marketing can&#39;t simply be seen as just the production of infographics, whitepapers, blogs and podcasts. Great content marketing involves a number of other factors that need to be addressed in addition to the content itself. </p>
<br />

<p>Here&#39;s how I break down the qualities of fantastic content marketing:</p>
<br />
<p><b>1. Quality Content</b></p>
<br />
<p>There&#39;s nothing more valuable to a marketer than a great piece of content. It can be used for brand awareness, lead capture, it can be broken down and used as multiple items. But it needs to be very high quality and it needs to be genuinely insightful to your audience. No skimping here. It&#39;s important.</p>

<p><b>2. Attractive Content Packaging</b></p>
<br />
<p>So you&#39;ve spent weeks putting together an amazing whitepaper/podcast/video… and you’re going to throw it up on a plain website with no calls to action and below-average design? Not a chance. You&#39;re going to make sure it sits on a properly designed webpage that has the clear and relevant call to action for your audience.</p>

<br />
<p><b>3. Coordinated Distribution</b></p>
<br />
<p>The point of a content marketing strategy is to build trust, generate awareness and drive traffic / capture leads. Creating the content is obviously the most important step, but if you’re not effectively distributing it, then it&#39;s kind of missing the point. You need to make sure that you’re sharing it on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter (and anywhere else applicable.) Also, make sure that you&#39;re letting people know to share it by sending a company wide email or using a tool like <a href="http://www.getelevate.com">Elevate.</a></p>

<br />
<p><b>4. Tracking & Measurement</b></p>
<br />
<p>It&#39;s very difficult to improve at anything that you&#39;re not tracking. As true as it stands for your sales process or your customer support, it holds just as true for content marketing. What was the type of content that people responded to? Did they prefer podcasts or whitepapers? Could you make the title of the video tighter or the call to action more clear? Make sure to measure what you want to improve.</p>

<br />
<p><b>5. Recycling</b></p>
<br />
<p>A key component of any good content marketing strategy is how you can break up and reuse your content. For instance, can you break up your whitepapers into a 5 day email course? Or can you combine your best blog posts to put together a new whitepaper? Did you cover a topic in your email marketing that you might want to make a video of using the same copy? The lesson is not to waste anything!</p>
<br />

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<br />
<p>Content marketing means more than just producing quality content but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s complicated. By keeping in mind these 5 steps you should find it straightforward to achieve your content marketing goals and drive significant online engagement.</p>
