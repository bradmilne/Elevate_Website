title: 7 Reasons Why You Should Choose Employees For Your B2B Brand Ambassador Program
---
<p>2013 seems to be the year where B2B marketing departments will fully embrace content marketing as their highest priority marketing initiative. These <a href="http://www.ragan.com/Main/Articles/24_stats_about_the_importance_of_content_marketing_46163.aspx#">24 stats about the state of content marketing</a> should make it clear that if you’re not thinking about content marketing… you might want to start.</p>
<br />


<p>The reason for all the commotion? <b>Because a the end of the day, a client needs to be able to trust you - and providing high quality content that demonstrates your expertise in your space is the best way to earn that trust.</b></p>
<br />

<p>I&#39;ll leave what kind of content you need to produce and how frequently you need to produce it to a different discussion - for now we&#39;ll stick to your <b>b2b brand ambassador program, why employees should absolutely be on the brand ambassador shortlist, and how this will help amplify your content marketing efforts.</b></p>

<p><b>Your employees are fantastic for brand ambassador programs because:</b></p>
<br />

<p><b>1. Their interests are aligned</b></p>
<br />

<p>Employees do well when their company does well. Annual bonuses, bragging rights, feeling of job security, etc. </p>
<br />

<p><b>2. They understand what you do.</b></p>
<br />

<p>They intuitively understand the content you’re producing and know what to share why, and how to explain it.</p>
<br />

<p><b>3. They&#39;re connected with your target audience.</b></p>
<br />

<p>Employees know your customers. They also know other employees, potential customers, suppliers, and resellers. Chances are they’re connected to them online and when they reshare your content, it will be seen by the right people.</p>
<br />

<p><b>4. You have their email addresses.</b></p>
<br />

<p>How are you going to let your brand ambassadors know that they need to share something NOW? You email them. Or you set up tools like <a href="http://www.getelevate.com">Elevate</a> to make sure they know. But you can only do that if you have their email.</p>
<br />

<p><b>5. You know them personally.</b></p>
<br />

<p>You just invested &#36;20k in your latest content marketing effort and you want to make sure your brand ambassadors understand why you want them to reshare your content. With your employees you can simply walk down the hall and talk to them.</p>
<br />

<p><b>6. They represent your brand.</b></p>
<br />

<p>Employees work for a company. The way that I see it is that employees ARE the company. They represent the company better than the brand itself and when people have positive interactions with an employee it makes a massive different in how that person feels about the company.</p>
<br />

<p><b>7. They care.</b></p>
<br />

<p>Employees (the good ones at least) care about where they work. They care about their colleagues and they care about their customers.  These employees are the ones that you want resharing company content online and representing the brand - because it&#39;s an extension of themselves.</p>
<br />

<p>If you&#39;re looking to setup a brand ambassador program or if you already have one running, make sure that you’ve included employees as part of it. Otherwise you’re going to miss out on the people who represent your brand best.</p>
